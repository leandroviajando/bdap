    "Why Use Hash-Based Sampling?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproducibility: Given the same input and bucket configuration, the sampling will always yield the same result because the hash function is deterministic.\n",
    "- Efficient for Streaming: You don’t need to store all the items in memory; you can sample from a continuous stream without looking at all the data at once.\n",
    "- Scalable: Hashing can be done in constant time  O(1) , and the number of buckets can be adjusted to control the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hashing:\n",
    "\t- We use Python’s built-in hash() function to hash each elephant (or item in the stream).\n",
    "\t- The hash value is then divided by the number of buckets (num_buckets) to assign the item to a bucket using the modulus operator (%).\n",
    "2.\tSampling:\n",
    "\t- In both the non-streaming and streaming versions, we only select items that belong to the specified selected_bucket. This ensures that a deterministic subset of the population is selected based on the hash values.\n",
    "3.\tNon-Streaming (Batch):\n",
    "\t- The function processes the entire list of elephants at once, hashes each item, and selects those in the designated bucket.\n",
    "4.\tStreaming:\n",
    "\t- The streaming version processes the elephants one by one (as if they were arriving over time), making it ideal for situations where the full dataset can’t fit in memory, or you’re handling a continuous stream of data."
